## About this guide

Components are documented explaining how to use them & what options they expect.
This guide is setup so that notifications (notistack), Material UI theme, Redux, are all setup.

### UI Components

Components are automatically added to the tool when you add a `*.examples.md` in the same folder as the component - no need to restart styleguide.

You can see how components handle different props and data right in your browser.

Find the right combination of props and copy the code.
